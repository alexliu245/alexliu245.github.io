Deployment
-----

1. All development work is done on /development; since github pages only allows /master as source branch, we have to work around that and keep our react code elsewhere

2. Once ready to deploy on development, run `npm run deploy`. This will generate a static version of our react app and place that on /gh-pages

3. Merge /gh-pages into /master

This is all done using react/gh-pages, [source code here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)
